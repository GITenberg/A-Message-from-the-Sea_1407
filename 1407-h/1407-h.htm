<h1>A MESSAGE FROM THE SEA</h1>
<h2>CHAPTER I&mdash;THE VILLAGE</h2>
<p>&ldquo;And a mighty sing&rsquo;lar and pretty place it is, as ever
I saw in all the days of my life!&rdquo; said Captain Jorgan, looking
up at it.</p>
<p>Captain Jorgan had to look high to look at it, for the village was
built sheer up the face of a steep and lofty cliff.&nbsp; There was
no road in it, there was no wheeled vehicle in it, there was not a level
yard in it.&nbsp; From the sea-beach to the cliff-top two irregular
rows of white houses, placed opposite to one another, and twisting here
and there, and there and here, rose, like the sides of a long succession
of stages of crooked ladders, and you climbed up the village or climbed
down the village by the staves between, some six feet wide or so, and
made of sharp irregular stones.&nbsp; The old pack-saddle, long laid
aside in most parts of England as one of the appendages of its infancy,
flourished here intact.&nbsp; Strings of pack-horses and pack-donkeys
toiled slowly up the staves of the ladders, bearing fish, and coal,
and such other cargo as was unshipping at the pier from the dancing
fleet of village boats, and from two or three little coasting traders.&nbsp;
As the beasts of burden ascended laden, or descended light, they got
so lost at intervals in the floating clouds of village smoke, that they
seemed to dive down some of the village chimneys, and come to the surface
again far off, high above others.&nbsp; No two houses in the village
were alike, in chimney, size, shape, door, window, gable, roof-tree,
anything.&nbsp; The sides of the ladders were musical with water, running
clear and bright.&nbsp; The staves were musical with the clattering
feet of the pack-horses and pack-donkeys, and the voices of the fishermen
urging them up, mingled with the voices of the fishermen&rsquo;s wives
and their many children.&nbsp; The pier was musical with the wash of
the sea, the creaking of capstans and windlasses, and the airy fluttering
of little vanes and sails.&nbsp; The rough, sea-bleached boulders of
which the pier was made, and the whiter boulders of the shore, were
brown with drying nets.&nbsp; The red-brown cliffs, richly wooded to
their extremest verge, had their softened and beautiful forms reflected
in the bluest water, under the clear North Devonshire sky of a November
day without a cloud.&nbsp; The village itself was so steeped in autumnal
foliage, from the houses lying on the pier to the topmost round of the
topmost ladder, that one might have fancied it was out a bird&rsquo;s-nesting,
and was (as indeed it was) a wonderful climber.&nbsp; And mentioning
birds, the place was not without some music from them too; for the rook
was very busy on the higher levels, and the gull with his flapping wings
was fishing in the bay, and the lusty little robin was hopping among
the great stone blocks and iron rings of the breakwater, fearless in
the faith of his ancestors, and the Children in the Wood.</p>
<p>Thus it came to pass that Captain Jorgan, sitting balancing himself
on the pier-wall, struck his leg with his open hand, as some men do
when they are pleased&mdash;and as he always did when he was pleased&mdash;and
said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A mighty sing&rsquo;lar and pretty place it is, as ever I
saw in all the days of my life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Jorgan had not been through the village, but had come down
to the pier by a winding side-road, to have a preliminary look at it
from the level of his own natural element.&nbsp; He had seen many things
and places, and had stowed them all away in a shrewd intellect and a
vigorous memory.&nbsp; He was an American born, was Captain Jorgan,&mdash;a
New-Englander,&mdash;but he was a citizen of the world, and a combination
of most of the best qualities of most of its best countries.</p>
<p>For Captain Jorgan to sit anywhere in his long-skirted blue coat
and blue trousers, without holding converse with everybody within speaking
distance, was a sheer impossibility.&nbsp; So the captain fell to talking
with the fishermen, and to asking them knowing questions about the fishery,
and the tides, and the currents, and the race of water off that point
yonder, and what you kept in your eye, and got into a line with what
else when you ran into the little harbour; and other nautical profundities.&nbsp;
Among the men who exchanged ideas with the captain was a young fellow,
who exactly hit his fancy,&mdash;a young fisherman of two or three and
twenty, in the rough sea-dress of his craft, with a brown face, dark
curling hair, and bright, modest eyes under his Sou&rsquo;wester hat,
and with a frank, but simple and retiring manner, which the captain
found uncommonly taking.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d bet a thousand dollars,&rdquo;
said the captain to himself, &ldquo;that your father was an honest man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might you be married now?&rdquo; asked the captain, when he
had had some talk with this new acquaintance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to be?&rdquo; said the captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain&rsquo;s keen glance followed the slightest possible turn
of the dark eye, and the slightest possible tilt of the Sou&rsquo;wester
hat.&nbsp; The captain then slapped both his legs, and said to himself,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never knew such a good thing in all my life!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
his sweetheart looking over the wall!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a very pretty girl looking over the wall, from a little
platform of cottage, vine, and fuchsia; and she certainly dig not look
as if the presence of this young fisherman in the landscape made it
any the less sunny and hopeful for her.</p>
<p>Captain Jorgan, having doubled himself up to laugh with that hearty
good-nature which is quite exultant in the innocent happiness of other
people, had undoubted himself, and was going to start a new subject,
when there appeared coming down the lower ladders of stones, a man whom
he hailed as &ldquo;Tom Pettifer, Ho!&rdquo;&nbsp; Tom Pettifer, Ho,
responded with alacrity, and in speedy course descended on the pier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afraid of a sun-stroke in England in November, Tom, that you
wear your tropical hat, strongly paid outside and paper-lined inside,
here?&rdquo; said the captain, eyeing it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s as well to be on the safe side, sir,&rdquo; replied
Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Safe side!&rdquo; repeated the captain, laughing.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;d
guard against a sun-stroke, with that old hat, in an Ice Pack.&nbsp;
Wa&rsquo;al!&nbsp; What have you made out at the Post-office?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> the Post-office, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the Post-office?&rdquo; said the captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The name, sir.&nbsp; The name keeps the Post-office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A coincidence!&rdquo; said the captain.&nbsp; &ldquo;A lucky
bit!&nbsp; Show me where it is.&nbsp; Good-bye, shipmates, for the present!&nbsp;
I shall come and have another look at you, afore I leave, this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was addressed to all there, but especially the young fisherman;
so all there acknowledged it, but especially the young fisherman.&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>He&rsquo;s</i> a sailor!&rdquo; said one to another, as they
looked after the captain moving away.&nbsp; That he was; and so outspeaking
was the sailor in him, that although his dress had nothing nautical
about it, with the single exception of its colour, but was a suit of
a shore-going shape and form, too long in the sleeves and too short
in the legs, and too unaccommodating everywhere, terminating earthward
in a pair of Wellington boots, and surmounted by a tall, stiff hat,
which no mortal could have worn at sea in any wind under heaven; nevertheless,
a glimpse of his sagacious, weather-beaten face, or his strong, brown
hand, would have established the captain&rsquo;s calling.&nbsp; Whereas
Mr. Pettifer&mdash;a man of a certain plump neatness, with a curly whisker,
and elaborately nautical in a jacket, and shoes, and all things correspondent&mdash;looked
no more like a seaman, beside Captain Jorgan, than he looked like a
sea-serpent.</p>
<p>The two climbed high up the village,&mdash;which had the most arbitrary
turns and twists in it, so that the cobbler&rsquo;s house came dead
across the ladder, and to have held a reasonable course, you must have
gone through his house, and through him too, as he sat at his work between
two little windows,&mdash;with one eye microscopically on the geological
formation of that part of Devonshire, and the other telescopically on
the open sea,&mdash;the two climbed high up the village, and stopped
before a quaint little house, on which was painted, &ldquo;MRS. RAYBROCK,
DRAPER;&rdquo; and also &ldquo;POST-OFFICE.&rdquo;&nbsp; Before it,
ran a rill of murmuring water, and access to it was gained by a little
plank-bridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the name,&rdquo; said Captain Jorgan, &ldquo;sure
enough.&nbsp; You can come in if you like, Tom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain opened the door, and passed into an odd little shop,
about six feet high, with a great variety of beams and bumps in the
ceiling, and, besides the principal window giving on the ladder of stones,
a purblind little window of a single pane of glass, peeping out of an
abutting corner at the sun-lighted ocean, and winking at its brightness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo; said the captain.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am very glad to see you.&nbsp; I have come a long way to see
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Have</i> you, sir?&nbsp; Then I am sure I am very glad
to see <i>you</i>, though I don&rsquo;t know you from Adam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus a comely elderly woman, short of stature, plump of form, sparkling
and dark of eye, who, perfectly clean and neat herself, stood in the
midst of her perfectly clean and neat arrangements, and surveyed Captain
Jorgan with smiling curiosity.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah! but you are a sailor,
sir,&rdquo; she added, almost immediately, and with a slight movement
of her hands, that was not very unlike wringing them; &ldquo;then you
are heartily welcome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank&rsquo;ee, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said the captain, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know what it is, I am sure; that brings out the salt in
me, but everybody seems to see it on the crown of my hat and the collar
of my coat.&nbsp; Yes, ma&rsquo;am, I am in that way of life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the other gentleman, too,&rdquo; said Mrs. Raybrock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well now, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said the captain, glancing shrewdly
at the other gentleman, &ldquo;you are that nigh right, that he goes
to sea,&mdash;if that makes him a sailor.&nbsp; This is my steward,
ma&rsquo;am, Tom Pettifer; he&rsquo;s been a&rsquo;most all trades you
could name, in the course of his life,&mdash;would have bought all your
chairs and tables once, if you had wished to sell &rsquo;em,&mdash;but
now he&rsquo;s my steward.&nbsp; My name&rsquo;s Jorgan, and I&rsquo;m
a ship-owner, and I sail my own and my partners&rsquo; ships, and have
done so this five-and-twenty year.&nbsp; According to custom I am called
Captain Jorgan, but I am no more a captain, bless your heart, than you
are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;ll come into my parlour, sir, and take a
chair?&rdquo; said Mrs. Raybrock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ex-actly what I was going to propose myself, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp;
After you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus replying, and enjoining Tom to give an eye to the shop, Captain
Jorgan followed Mrs. Raybrock into the little, low back-room,&mdash;decorated
with divers plants in pots, tea-trays, old china teapots, and punch-bowls,&mdash;which
was at once the private sitting-room of the Raybrock family and the
inner cabinet of the post-office of the village of Steepways.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said the captain, &ldquo;it don&rsquo;t
signify a cent to you where I was born, except&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; But
here the shadow of some one entering fell upon the captain&rsquo;s figure,
and he broke off to double himself up, slap both his legs, and ejaculate,
&ldquo;Never knew such a thing in all my life!&nbsp; Here he is again!&nbsp;
How are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>These words referred to the young fellow who had so taken Captain
Jorgan&rsquo;s fancy down at the pier.&nbsp; To make it all quite complete
he came in accompanied by the sweetheart whom the captain had detected
looking over the wall.&nbsp; A prettier sweetheart the sun could not
have shone upon that shining day.&nbsp; As she stood before the captain,
with her rosy lips just parted in surprise, her brown eyes a little
wider open than was usual from the same cause, and her breathing a little
quickened by the ascent (and possibly by some mysterious hurry and flurry
at the parlour door, in which the captain had observed her face to be
for a moment totally eclipsed by the Sou&rsquo;wester hat), she looked
so charming, that the captain felt himself under a moral obligation
to slap both his legs again.&nbsp; She was very simply dressed, with
no other ornament than an autumnal flower in her bosom.&nbsp; She wore
neither hat nor bonnet, but merely a scarf or kerchief, folded squarely
back over the head, to keep the sun off,&mdash;according to a fashion
that may be sometimes seen in the more genial parts of England as well
as of Italy, and which is probably the first fashion of head-dress that
came into the world when grasses and leaves went out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my country,&rdquo; said the captain, rising to give her
his chair, and dexterously sliding it close to another chair on which
the young fisherman must necessarily establish himself,&mdash;&ldquo;in
my country we should call Devonshire beauty first-rate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whenever a frank manner is offensive, it is because it is strained
or feigned; for there may be quite as much intolerable affectation in
plainness as in mincing nicety.&nbsp; All that the captain said and
did was honestly according to his nature; and his nature was open nature
and good nature; therefore, when he paid this little compliment, and
expressed with a sparkle or two of his knowing eye, &ldquo;I see how
it is, and nothing could be better,&rdquo; he had established a delicate
confidence on that subject with the family.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was saying to your worthy mother,&rdquo; said the captain
to the young man, after again introducing himself by name and occupation,&mdash;&ldquo;I
was saying to your mother (and you&rsquo;re very like her) that it didn&rsquo;t
signify where I was born, except that I was raised on question-asking
ground, where the babies as soon as ever they come into the world, inquire
of their mothers, &lsquo;Neow, how old may <i>you</i> be, and wa&rsquo;at
air you a goin&rsquo; to name me?&rsquo;&mdash;which is a fact.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Here he slapped his leg.&nbsp; &ldquo;Such being the case, I may be
excused for asking you if your name&rsquo;s Alfred?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, my name is Alfred,&rdquo; returned the young man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not a conjurer,&rdquo; pursued the captain, &ldquo;and
don&rsquo;t think me so, or I shall right soon undeceive you.&nbsp;
Likewise don&rsquo;t think, if you please, though I <i>do</i> come from
that country of the babies, that I am asking questions for question-asking&rsquo;s
sake, for I am not.&nbsp; Somebody belonging to you went to sea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My elder brother, Hugh,&rdquo; returned the young man.&nbsp;
He said it in an altered and lower voice, and glanced at his mother,
who raised her hands hurriedly, and put them together across her black
gown, and looked eagerly at the visitor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&nbsp; For God&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t think that!&rdquo;
said the captain, in a solemn way; &ldquo;I bring no good tidings of
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a silence, and the mother turned her face to the fire and
put her hand between it and her eyes.&nbsp; The young fisherman slightly
motioned toward the window, and the captain, looking in that direction,
saw a young widow, sitting at a neighbouring window across a little
garden, engaged in needlework, with a young child sleeping on her bosom.&nbsp;
The silence continued until the captain asked of Alfred,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long is it since it happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He shipped for his last voyage better than three years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ship struck upon some reef or rock, as I take it,&rdquo; said
the captain, &ldquo;and all hands lost?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wa&rsquo;al!&rdquo; said the captain, after a shorter silence,
&ldquo;Here I sit who may come to the same end, like enough.&nbsp; He
holds the seas in the hollow of His hand.&nbsp; We must all strike somewhere
and go down.&nbsp; Our comfort, then, for ourselves and one another
is to have done our duty.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d wager your brother did his!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did!&rdquo; answered the young fisherman.&nbsp; &ldquo;If
ever man strove faithfully on all occasions to do his duty, my brother
did.&nbsp; My brother was not a quick man (anything but that), but he
was a faithful, true, and just man.&nbsp; We were the sons of only a
small tradesman in this county, sir; yet our father was as watchful
of his good name as if he had been a king.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A precious sight more so, I hope&mdash;bearing in mind the
general run of that class of crittur,&rdquo; said the captain.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But I interrupt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My brother considered that our father left the good name to
us, to keep clear and true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your brother considered right,&rdquo; said the captain; &ldquo;and
you couldn&rsquo;t take care of a better legacy.&nbsp; But again I interrupt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; for I have nothing more to say.&nbsp; We know that Hugh
lived well for the good name, and we feel certain that he died well
for the good name.&nbsp; And now it has come into my keeping.&nbsp;
And that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well spoken!&rdquo; cried the captain.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well spoken,
young man!&nbsp; Concerning the manner of your brother&rsquo;s death,&rdquo;&mdash;by
this time the captain had released the hand he had shaken, and sat with
his own broad, brown hands spread out on his knees, and spoke aside,&mdash;&ldquo;concerning
the manner of your brother&rsquo;s death, it may be that I have some
information to give you; though it may not be, for I am far from sure.&nbsp;
Can we have a little talk alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man rose; but not before the captain&rsquo;s quick eye
had noticed that, on the pretty sweetheart&rsquo;s turning to the window
to greet the young widow with a nod and a wave of the hand, the young
widow had held up to her the needlework on which she was engaged, with
a patient and pleasant smile.&nbsp; So the captain said, being on his
legs,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What might she be making now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is Margaret making, Kitty?&rdquo; asked the young fisherman,&mdash;with
one of his arms apparently mislaid somewhere.</p>
<p>As Kitty only blushed in reply, the captain doubled himself up as
far as he could, standing, and said, with a slap of his leg,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my country we should call it wedding-clothes.&nbsp; Fact!&nbsp;
We should, I do assure you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it seemed to strike the captain in another light too; for his
laugh was not a long one, and he added, in quite a gentle tone,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s very pretty, my dear, to see her&mdash;poor
young thing, with her fatherless child upon her bosom&mdash;giving up
her thoughts to your home and your happiness.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s very
pretty, my dear, and it&rsquo;s very good.&nbsp; May your marriage be
more prosperous than hers, and be a comfort to her too.&nbsp; May the
blessed sun see you all happy together, in possession of the good name,
long after I have done ploughing the great salt field that is never
sown!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kitty answered very earnestly, &ldquo;O!&nbsp; Thank you, sir, with
all my heart!&rdquo;&nbsp; And, in her loving little way, kissed her
hand to him, and possibly by implication to the young fisherman, too,
as the latter held the parlour-door open for the captain to pass out.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II&mdash;THE MONEY</h2>
<p>&ldquo;The stairs are very narrow, sir,&rdquo; said Alfred Raybrock
to Captain Jorgan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like my cabin-stairs,&rdquo; returned the captain, &ldquo;on
many a voyage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they are rather inconvenient for the head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If my head can&rsquo;t take care of itself by this time, after
all the knocking about the world it has had,&rdquo; replied the captain,
as unconcernedly as if he had no connection with it, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
not worth looking after.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus they came into the young fisherman&rsquo;s bedroom, which was
as perfectly neat and clean as the shop and parlour below; though it
was but a little place, with a sliding window, and a phrenological ceiling
expressive of all the peculiarities of the house-roof.&nbsp; Here the
captain sat down on the foot of the bed, and glancing at a dreadful
libel on Kitty which ornamented the wall,&mdash;the production of some
wandering limner, whom the captain secretly admired as having studied
portraiture from the figure-heads of ships,&mdash;motioned to the young
man to take the rush-chair on the other side of the small round table.&nbsp;
That done, the captain put his hand in the deep breast-pocket of his
long-skirted blue coat, and took out of it a strong square case-bottle,&mdash;not
a large bottle, but such as may be seen in any ordinary ship&rsquo;s
medicine-chest.&nbsp; Setting this bottle on the table without removing
his hand from it, Captain Jorgan then spake as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my last voyage homeward-bound,&rdquo; said the captain,
&ldquo;and that&rsquo;s the voyage off of which I now come straight,
I encountered such weather off the Horn as is not very often met with,
even there.&nbsp; I have rounded that stormy Cape pretty often, and
I believe I first beat about there in the identical storms that blew
the Devil&rsquo;s horns and tail off, and led to the horns being worked
up into tooth-picks for the plantation overseers in my country, who
may be seen (if you travel down South, or away West, fur enough) picking
their teeth with &rsquo;em, while the whips, made of the tail, flog
hard.&nbsp; In this last voyage, homeward-bound for Liverpool from South
America, I say to you, my young friend, it blew.&nbsp; Whole measures!&nbsp;
No half measures, nor making believe to blow; it blew!&nbsp; Now I warn&rsquo;t
blown clean out of the water into the sky,&mdash;though I expected to
be even that,&mdash;but I was blown clean out of my course; and when
at last it fell calm, it fell dead calm, and a strong current set one
way, day and night, night and day, and I drifted&mdash;drifted&mdash;drifted&mdash;out
of all the ordinary tracks and courses of ships, and drifted yet, and
yet drifted.&nbsp; It behooves a man who takes charge of fellow-critturs&rsquo;
lives, never to rest from making himself master of his calling.&nbsp;
I never did rest, and consequently I knew pretty well (&rsquo;specially
looking over the side in the dead calm of that strong current) what
dangers to expect, and what precautions to take against &rsquo;em.&nbsp;
In short, we were driving head on to an island.&nbsp; There was no island
in the chart, and, therefore, you may say it was ill-manners in the
island to be there; I don&rsquo;t dispute its bad breeding, but there
it was.&nbsp; Thanks be to Heaven, I was as ready for the island as
the island was ready for me.&nbsp; I made it out myself from the masthead,
and I got enough way upon her in good time to keep her off.&nbsp; I
ordered a boat to be lowered and manned, and went in that boat myself
to explore the island.&nbsp; There was a reef outside it, and, floating
in a corner of the smooth water within the reef, was a heap of sea-weed,
and entangled in that sea-weed was this bottle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here the captain took his hand from the bottle for a moment, that
the young fisherman might direct a wondering glance at it; and then
replaced his band and went on:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If ever you come&mdash;or even if ever you don&rsquo;t come&mdash;to
a desert place, use you your eyes and your spy-glass well; for the smallest
thing you see may prove of use to you; and may have some information
or some warning in it.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the principle on which I came
to see this bottle.&nbsp; I picked up the bottle and ran the boat alongside
the island, and made fast and went ashore armed, with a part of my boat&rsquo;s
crew.&nbsp; We found that every scrap of vegetation on the island (I
give it you as my opinion, but scant and scrubby at the best of times)
had been consumed by fire.&nbsp; As we were making our way, cautiously
and toilsomely, over the pulverised embers, one of my people sank into
the earth breast-high.&nbsp; He turned pale, and &lsquo;Haul me out
smart, shipmates,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;for my feet are among bones.&rsquo;&nbsp;
We soon got him on his legs again, and then we dug up the spot, and
we found that the man was right, and that his feet had been among bones.&nbsp;
More than that, they were human bones; though whether the remains of
one man, or of two or three men, what with calcination and ashes, and
what with a poor practical knowledge of anatomy, I can&rsquo;t undertake
to say.&nbsp; We examined the whole island and made out nothing else,
save and except that, from its opposite side, I sighted a considerable
tract of land, which land I was able to identify, and according to the
bearings of which (not to trouble you with my log) I took a fresh departure.&nbsp;
When I got aboard again I opened the bottle, which was oilskin-covered
as you see, and glass-stoppered as you see.&nbsp; Inside of it,&rdquo;
pursued the captain, suiting his action to his words, &ldquo;I found
this little crumpled, folded paper, just as you see.&nbsp; Outside of
it was written, as you see, these words: &lsquo;Whoever finds this,
is solemnly entreated by the dead to convey it unread to Alfred Raybrock,
Steepways, North Devon, England.&rsquo;&nbsp; A sacred charge,&rdquo;
said the captain, concluding his narrative, &ldquo;and, Alfred Raybrock,
there it is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is my poor brother&rsquo;s writing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; said Captain Jorgan.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
take a look out of this little window while you read it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray no, sir!&nbsp; I should be hurt.&nbsp; My brother couldn&rsquo;t
know it would fall into such hands as yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain sat down again on the foot of the bed, and the young
man opened the folded paper with a trembling hand, and spread it on
the table.&nbsp; The ragged paper, evidently creased and torn both before
and after being written on, was much blotted and stained, and the ink
had faded and run, and many words were wanting.&nbsp; What the captain
and the young fisherman made out together, after much re-reading and
much humouring of the folds of the paper, is given on the next page.</p>
<p>The young fisherman had become more and more agitated, as the writing
had become clearer to him.&nbsp; He now left it lying before the captain,
over whose shoulder he had been reading it, and dropping into his former
seat, leaned forward on the table and laid his face in his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, man,&rdquo; urged the captain, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t give
in!&nbsp; Be up and doing <i>like</i> a man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is selfish, I know,&mdash;but doing what, doing what?&rdquo;
cried the young fisherman, in complete despair, and stamping his sea-boot
on the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doing what?&rdquo; returned the captain.&nbsp; &ldquo;Something!&nbsp;
I&rsquo;d go down to the little breakwater below yonder, and take a
wrench at one of the salt-rusted iron rings there, and either wrench
it up by the roots or wrench my teeth out of my head, sooner than I&rsquo;d
do nothing.&nbsp; Nothing!&rdquo; ejaculated the captain.&nbsp; &ldquo;Any
fool or fainting heart can do <i>that</i>, and nothing can come of nothing,&mdash;which
was pretended to be found out, I believe, by one of them Latin critters,&rdquo;
said the captain with the deepest disdain; &ldquo;as if Adam hadn&rsquo;t
found it out, afore ever he so much as named the beasts!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet the captain saw, in spite of his bold words, that there was some
greater reason than he yet understood for the young man&rsquo;s distress.&nbsp;
And he eyed him with a sympathising curiosity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come!&rdquo; continued the captain, &ldquo;Speak out.&nbsp;
What is it, boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have seen how beautiful she is, sir,&rdquo; said the young
man, looking up for the moment, with a flushed face and rumpled hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did any man ever say she warn&rsquo;t beautiful?&rdquo; retorted
the captain.&nbsp; &ldquo;If so, go and lick him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man laughed fretfully in spite of himself, and said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that, it&rsquo;s not that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wa&rsquo;al, then, what is it?&rdquo; said the captain in
a more soothing tone.</p>
<p>The young fisherman mournfully composed himself to tell the captain
what it was, and began: &ldquo;We were to have been married next Monday
week&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were to have been!&rdquo; interrupted Captain Jorgan.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And are to be?&nbsp; Hey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Young Raybrock shook his head, and traced out with his fore-finger
the words, &ldquo;<i>poor father&rsquo;s five hundred pounds</i>,&rdquo;
in the written paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go along,&rdquo; said the captain.&nbsp; &ldquo;Five hundred
pounds?&nbsp; Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sum of money,&rdquo; pursued the young fisherman, entering
with the greatest earnestness on his demonstration, while the captain
eyed him with equal earnestness, &ldquo;was all my late father possessed.&nbsp;
When he died, he owed no man more than he left means to pay, but he
had been able to lay by only five hundred pounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five hundred pounds,&rdquo; repeated the captain.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In his lifetime, years before, he had expressly laid the money
aside to leave to my mother,&mdash;like to settle upon her, if I make
myself understood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had risked it once&mdash;my father put down in writing
at that time, respecting the money&mdash;and was resolved never to risk
it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a spectator,&rdquo; said the captain.&nbsp; &ldquo;My
country wouldn&rsquo;t have suited him.&nbsp; Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother has never touched the money till now.&nbsp; And
now it was to have been laid out, this very next week, in buying me
a handsome share in our neighbouring fishery here, to settle me in life
with Kitty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain&rsquo;s face fell, and he passed and repassed his sun-browned
right hand over his thin hair, in a discomfited manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kitty&rsquo;s father has no more than enough to live on, even
in the sparing way in which we live about here.&nbsp; He is a kind of
bailiff or steward of manor rights here, and they are not much, and
it is but a poor little office.&nbsp; He was better off once, and Kitty
must never marry to mere drudgery and hard living.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain still sat stroking his thin hair, and looking at the
young fisherman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am as certain that my father had no knowledge that any one
was wronged as to this money, or that any restitution ought to be made,
as I am certain that the sun now shines.&nbsp; But, after this solemn
warning from my brother&rsquo;s grave in the sea, that the money is
Stolen Money,&rdquo; said Young Raybrock, forcing himself to the utterance
of the words, &ldquo;can I doubt it?&nbsp; Can I touch it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About not doubting, I ain&rsquo;t so sure,&rdquo; observed
the captain; &ldquo;but about not touching&mdash;no&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
think you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See then,&rdquo; said Young Raybrock, &ldquo;why I am so grieved.&nbsp;
Think of Kitty.&nbsp; Think what I have got to tell her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His heart quite failed him again when he had come round to that,
and he once more beat his sea-boot softly on the floor.&nbsp; But not
for long; he soon began again, in a quietly resolute tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However!&nbsp; Enough of that!&nbsp; You spoke some brave
words to me just now, Captain Jorgan, and they shall not be spoken in
vain.&nbsp; I have got to do something.&nbsp; What I have got to do,
before all other things, is to trace out the meaning of this paper,
for the sake of the Good Name that has no one else to put it right.&nbsp;
And still for the sake of the Good Name, and my father&rsquo;s memory,
not a word of this writing must be breathed to my mother, or to Kitty,
or to any human creature.&nbsp; You agree in this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;ll think of us below,&rdquo;
said the captain, &ldquo;but for certain I can&rsquo;t oppose it.&nbsp;
Now, as to tracing.&nbsp; How will you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They both, as by consent, bent over the paper again, and again carefully
puzzled out the whole of the writing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I make out that this would stand, if all the writing was here,
&lsquo;Inquire among the old men living there, for&rsquo;&mdash;some
one.&nbsp; Most like, you&rsquo;ll go to this village named here?&rdquo;
said the captain, musing, with his finger on the name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&nbsp; And Mr. Tregarthen is a Cornishman, and&mdash;to
be sure!&mdash;comes from Lanrean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does he?&rdquo; said the captain quietly.&nbsp; &ldquo;As
I ain&rsquo;t acquainted with him, who may <i>he</i> be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Tregarthen is Kitty&rsquo;s father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay!&rdquo; cried the captain.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now you speak!&nbsp;
Tregarthen knows this village of Lanrean, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beyond all doubt he does.&nbsp; I have often heard him mention
it, as being his native place.&nbsp; He knows it well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop half a moment,&rdquo; said the captain.&nbsp; &ldquo;We
want a name here.&nbsp; You could ask Tregarthen (or if you couldn&rsquo;t
I could) what names of old men he remembers in his time in those diggings?&nbsp;
Hey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can go straight to his cottage, and ask him now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take me with you,&rdquo; said the captain, rising in a solid
way that had a most comfortable reliability in it, &ldquo;and just a
word more first.&nbsp; I have knocked about harder than you, and have
got along further than you.&nbsp; I have had, all my sea-going life
long, to keep my wits polished bright with acid and friction, like the
brass cases of the ship&rsquo;s instruments.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll keep you
company on this expedition.&nbsp; Now you don&rsquo;t live by talking
any more than I do.&nbsp; Clench that hand of yours in this hand of
mine, and that&rsquo;s a speech on both sides.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Jorgan took command of the expedition with that hearty shake.&nbsp;
He at once refolded the paper exactly as before, replaced it in the
bottle, put the stopper in, put the oilskin over the stopper, confided
the whole to Young Raybrock&rsquo;s keeping, and led the way down-stairs.</p>
<p>But it was harder navigation below-stairs than above.&nbsp; The instant
they set foot in the parlour the quick, womanly eye detected that there
was something wrong.&nbsp; Kitty exclaimed, frightened, as she ran to
her lover&rsquo;s side, &ldquo;Alfred!&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;&nbsp;
Mrs. Raybrock cried out to the captain, &ldquo;Gracious! what have you
done to my son to change him like this all in a minute?&rdquo;&nbsp;
And the young widow&mdash;who was there with her work upon her arm&mdash;was
at first so agitated that she frightened the little girl she held in
her hand, who hid her face in her mother&rsquo;s skirts and screamed.&nbsp;
The captain, conscious of being held responsible for this domestic change,
contemplated it with quite a guilty expression of countenance, and looked
to the young fisherman to come to his rescue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kitty, darling,&rdquo; said Young Raybrock, &ldquo;Kitty,
dearest love, I must go away to Lanrean, and I don&rsquo;t know where
else or how much further, this very day.&nbsp; Worse than that&mdash;our
marriage, Kitty, must be put off, and I don&rsquo;t know for how long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kitty stared at him, in doubt and wonder and in anger, and pushed
him from her with her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put off?&rdquo; cried Mrs. Raybrock.&nbsp; &ldquo;The marriage
put off?&nbsp; And you going to Lanrean!&nbsp; Why, in the name of the
dear Lord?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother dear, I can&rsquo;t say why; I must not say why.&nbsp;
It would be dishonourable and undutiful to say why.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dishonourable and undutiful?&rdquo; returned the dame.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And is there nothing dishonourable or undutiful in the boy&rsquo;s
breaking the heart of his own plighted love, and his mother&rsquo;s
heart too, for the sake of the dark secrets and counsels of a wicked
stranger?&nbsp; Why did you ever come here?&rdquo; she apostrophised
the innocent captain.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who wanted you?&nbsp; Where did you
come from?&nbsp; Why couldn&rsquo;t you rest in your own bad place,
wherever it is, instead of disturbing the peace of quiet unoffending
folk like us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what,&rdquo; sobbed the poor little Kitty, &ldquo;have
I ever done to you, you hard and cruel captain, that you should come
and serve me so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then they both began to weep most pitifully, while the captain
could only look from the one to the other, and lay hold of himself by
the coat collar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Margaret,&rdquo; said the poor young fisherman, on his knees
at Kitty&rsquo;s feet, while Kitty kept both her hands before her tearful
face, to shut out the traitor from her view,&mdash;but kept her fingers
wide asunder and looked at him all the time,&mdash;&ldquo;Margaret,
you have suffered so much, so uncomplainingly, and are always so careful
and considerate!&nbsp; Do take my part, for poor Hugh&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The quiet Margaret was not appealed to in vain.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will,
Alfred,&rdquo; she returned, &ldquo;and I do.&nbsp; I wish this gentleman
had never come near us;&rdquo; whereupon the captain laid hold of himself
the tighter; &ldquo;but I take your part for all that.&nbsp; I am sure
you have some strong reason and some sufficient reason for what you
do, strange as it is, and even for not saying why you do it, strange
as that is.&nbsp; And, Kitty darling, you are bound to think so more
than any one, for true love believes everything, and bears everything,
and trusts everything.&nbsp; And, mother dear, you are bound to think
so too, for you know you have been blest with good sons, whose word
was always as good as their oath, and who were brought up in as true
a sense of honour as any gentleman in this land.&nbsp; And I am sure
you have no more call, mother, to doubt your living son than to doubt
your dead son; and for the sake of the dear dead, I stand up for the
dear living.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wa&rsquo;al now,&rdquo; the captain struck in, with enthusiasm,
&ldquo;this I say, That whether your opinions flatter me or not, you
are a young woman of sense, and spirit, and feeling; and I&rsquo;d sooner
have you by my side in the hour of danger, than a good half of the men
I&rsquo;ve ever fallen in with&mdash;or fallen out with, ayther.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Margaret did not return the captain&rsquo;s compliment, or appear
fully to reciprocate his good opinion, but she applied herself to the
consolation of Kitty, and of Kitty&rsquo;s mother-in-law that was to
have been next Monday week, and soon restored the parlour to a quiet
condition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kitty, my darling,&rdquo; said the young fisherman, &ldquo;I
must go to your father to entreat him still to trust me in spite of
this wretched change and mystery, and to ask him for some directions
concerning Lanrean.&nbsp; Will you come home?&nbsp; Will you come with
me, Kitty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kitty answered not a word, but rose sobbing, with the end of her
simple head-dress at her eyes.&nbsp; Captain Jorgan followed the lovers
out, quite sheepishly, pausing in the shop to give an instruction to
Mr. Pettifer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, Tom!&rdquo; said the captain, in a low voice.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s something in your line.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s an old
lady poorly and low in her spirits.&nbsp; Cheer her up a bit, Tom.&nbsp;
Cheer &rsquo;em all up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Pettifer, with a brisk nod of intelligence, immediately assumed
his steward face, and went with his quiet, helpful, steward step into
the parlour, where the captain had the great satisfaction of seeing
him, through the glass door, take the child in his arms (who offered
no objection), and bend over Mrs. Raybrock, administering soft words
of consolation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Though what he finds to say, unless he&rsquo;s telling her
that &rsquo;t&rsquo;ll soon be over, or that most people is so at first,
or that it&rsquo;ll do her good afterward, I cannot imaginate!&rdquo;
was the captain&rsquo;s reflection as he followed the lovers.</p>
<p>He had not far to follow them, since it was but a short descent down
the stony ways to the cottage of Kitty&rsquo;s father.&nbsp; But short
as the distance was, it was long enough to enable the captain to observe
that he was fast becoming the village Ogre; for there was not a woman
standing working at her door, or a fisherman coming up or going down,
who saw Young Raybrock unhappy and little Kitty in tears, but he or
she instantly darted a suspicious and indignant glance at the captain,
as the foreigner who must somehow be responsible for this unusual spectacle.&nbsp;
Consequently, when they came into Tregarthen&rsquo;s little garden,&mdash;which
formed the platform from which the captain had seen Kitty peeping over
the wall,&mdash;the captain brought to, and stood off and on at the
gate, while Kitty hurried to hide her tears in her own room, and Alfred
spoke with her father, who was working in the garden.&nbsp; He was a
rather infirm man, but could scarcely be called old yet, with an agreeable
face and a promising air of making the best of things.&nbsp; The conversation
began on his side with great cheerfulness and good humour, but soon
became distrustful, and soon angry.&nbsp; That was the captain&rsquo;s
cue for striking both into the conversation and the garden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Morning, sir!&rdquo; said Captain Jorgan.&nbsp; &ldquo;How
do you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gentleman I am going away with,&rdquo; said the young
fisherman to Tregarthen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O!&rdquo; returned Kitty&rsquo;s father, surveying the unfortunate
captain with a look of extreme disfavour.&nbsp; &ldquo;I confess that
I can&rsquo;t say I am glad to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the captain, &ldquo;and, to admit the truth,
that seems to be the general opinion in these parts.&nbsp; But don&rsquo;t
be hasty; you may think better of me by-and-by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; observed Tregarthen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wa&rsquo;al, <i>I</i> hope so,&rdquo; observed the captain,
quite at his ease; &ldquo;more than that, I believe so,&mdash;though
you don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Now, Mr. Tregarthen, you don&rsquo;t want to
exchange words of mistrust with me; and if you did, you couldn&rsquo;t,
because I wouldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; You and I are old enough to know better
than to judge against experience from surfaces and appearances; and
if you haven&rsquo;t lived to find out the evil and injustice of such
judgments, you are a lucky man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other seemed to shrink under this remark, and replied, &ldquo;Sir,
I <i>have</i> lived to feel it deeply.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wa&rsquo;al,&rdquo; said the captain, mollified, &ldquo;then
I&rsquo;ve made a good cast without knowing it.&nbsp; Now, Tregarthen,
there stands the lover of your only child, and here stand I who know
his secret.&nbsp; I warrant it a righteous secret, and none of his making,
though bound to be of his keeping.&nbsp; I want to help him out with
it, and tewwards that end we ask you to favour us with the names of
two or three old residents in the village of Lanrean.&nbsp; As I am
taking out my pocket-book and pencil to put the names down, I may as
well observe to you that this, wrote atop of the first page here, is
my name and address: &lsquo;Silas Jonas Jorgan, Salem, Massachusetts,
United States.&rsquo;&nbsp; If ever you take it in your head to run
over any morning, I shall be glad to welcome you.&nbsp; Now, what may
be the spelling of these said names?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was an elderly man,&rdquo; said Tregarthen, &ldquo;named
David Polreath.&nbsp; He may be dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wa&rsquo;al,&rdquo; said the captain, cheerfully, &ldquo;if
Polreath&rsquo;s dead and buried, and can be made of any service to
us, Polreath won&rsquo;t object to our digging of him up.&nbsp; Polreath&rsquo;s
down, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was another named Penrewen.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know
his Christian name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind his Chris&rsquo;en name,&rdquo; said the captain;
&ldquo;Penrewen, for short.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was another named John Tredgear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a pleasant-sounding name, too,&rdquo; said the captain;
&ldquo;John Tredgear&rsquo;s booked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can recall no other except old Parvis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of old Parvis&rsquo;s fam&rsquo;ly I reckon,&rdquo; said
the captain, &ldquo;kept a dry-goods store in New York city, and realised
a handsome competency by burning his house to ashes.&nbsp; Same name,
anyhow.&nbsp; David Polreath, Unchris&rsquo;en Penrewen, John Tredgear,
and old Arson Parvis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot recall any others at the moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank&rsquo;ee,&rdquo; said the captain.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
so, Tregarthen, hoping for your good opinion yet, and likewise for the
fair Devonshire Flower&rsquo;s, your daughter&rsquo;s, I give you my
hand, sir, and wish you good day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Young Raybrock accompanied him disconsolately; for there was no Kitty
at the window when he looked up, no Kitty in the garden when he shut
the gate, no Kitty gazing after them along the stony ways when they
begin to climb back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I tell you what,&rdquo; said the captain.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not
being at present calculated to promote harmony in your family, I won&rsquo;t
come in.&nbsp; You go and get your dinner at home, and I&rsquo;ll get
mine at the little hotel.&nbsp; Let our hour of meeting be two o&rsquo;clock,
and you&rsquo;ll find me smoking a cigar in the sun afore the hotel
door.&nbsp; Tell Tom Pettifer, my steward, to consider himself on duty,
and to look after your people till we come back; you&rsquo;ll find he&rsquo;ll
have made himself useful to &rsquo;em already, and will be quite acceptable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All was done as Captain Jorgan directed.&nbsp; Punctually at two
o&rsquo;clock the young fisherman appeared with his knapsack at his
back; and punctually at two o&rsquo;clock the captain jerked away the
last feather-end of his cigar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me carry your baggage, Captain Jorgan; I can easily take
it with mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank&rsquo;ee,&rdquo; said the captain.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
carry it myself.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s only a comb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They climbed out of the village, and paused among the trees and fern
on the summit of the hill above, to take breath, and to look down at
the beautiful sea.&nbsp; Suddenly the captain gave his leg a resounding
slap, and cried, &ldquo;Never knew such a right thing in all my life!&rdquo;&mdash;and
ran away.</p>
<p>The cause of this abrupt retirement on the part of the captain was
little Kitty among the trees.&nbsp; The captain went out of sight and
waited, and kept out of sight and waited, until it occurred to him to
beguile the time with another cigar.&nbsp; He lighted it, and smoked
it out, and still he was out of sight and waiting.&nbsp; He stole within
sight at last, and saw the lovers, with their arms entwined and their
bent heads touching, moving slowly among the trees.&nbsp; It was the
golden time of the afternoon then, and the captain said to himself,
&ldquo;Golden sun, golden sea, golden sails, golden leaves, golden love,
golden youth,&mdash;a golden state of things altogether!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nevertheless the captain found it necessary to hail his young companion
before going out of sight again.&nbsp; In a few moments more he came
up and they began their journey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That still young woman with the fatherless child,&rdquo; said
Captain Jorgan, as they fell into step, &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t throw her
words away; but good honest words are never thrown away.&nbsp; And now
that I am conveying you off from that tender little thing that loves,
and relies, and hopes, I feel just as if I was the snarling crittur
in the picters, with the tight legs, the long nose, and the feather
in his cap, the tips of whose moustaches get up nearer to his eyes the
wickeder he gets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young fisherman knew nothing of Mephistopheles; but he smiled
when the captain stopped to double himself up and slap his leg, and
they went along in right goodfellowship.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER V <a name="citation1"></a><a href="#footnote1">{1}</a>&mdash;THE
RESTITUTION</h2>
<p>Captain Jorgan, up and out betimes, had put the whole village of
Lanrean under an amicable cross-examination, and was returning to the
King Arthur&rsquo;s Arms to breakfast, none the wiser for his trouble,
when he beheld the young fisherman advancing to meet him, accompanied
by a stranger.&nbsp; A glance at this stranger assured the captain that
he could be no other than the Seafaring Man; and the captain was about
to hail him as a fellow-craftsman, when the two stood still and silent
before the captain, and the captain stood still, silent, and wondering
before them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; cried the captain, when at
last he broke the silence.&nbsp; &ldquo;You two are alike.&nbsp; You
two are much alike.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not a word was answered on the other side, until after the seafaring
brother had got hold of the captain&rsquo;s right hand, and the fisherman
brother had got hold of the captain&rsquo;s left hand; and if ever the
captain had had his fill of hand-shaking, from his birth to that hour,
he had it then.&nbsp; And presently up and spoke the two brothers, one
at a time, two at a time, two dozen at a time for the bewilderment into
which they plunged the captain, until he gradually had Hugh Raybrock&rsquo;s
deliverance made clear to him, and also unravelled the fact that the
person referred to in the half-obliterated paper was Tregarthen himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Formerly, dear Captain Jorgan,&rdquo; said Alfred, &ldquo;of
Lanrean, you recollect?&nbsp; Kitty and her father came to live at Steepways
after Hugh shipped on his last voyage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay!&rdquo; cried the captain, fetching a breath.&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>Now</i> you have me in tow.&nbsp; Then your brother here don&rsquo;t
know his sister-in-law that is to be so much as by name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never saw her; never heard of her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, ay!&rdquo; cried the captain.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why then
we every one go back together&mdash;paper, writer, and all&mdash;and
take Tregarthen into the secret we kept from him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; said Alfred, &ldquo;we can&rsquo;t help it
now.&nbsp; We must go through with our duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a doubt,&rdquo; returned the captain.&nbsp; &ldquo;Give
me an arm apiece, and let us set this ship-shape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So walking up and down in the shrill wind on the wild moor, while
the neglected breakfast cooled within, the captain and the brothers
settled their course of action.</p>
<p>It was that they should all proceed by the quickest means they could
secure to Barnstaple, and there look over the father&rsquo;s books and
papers in the lawyer&rsquo;s keeping; as Hugh had proposed to himself
to do if ever he reached home.&nbsp; That, enlightened or unenlightened,
they should then return to Steepways and go straight to Mr. Tregarthen,
and tell him all they knew, and see what came of it, and act accordingly.&nbsp;
Lastly, that when they got there they should enter the village with
all precautions against Hugh&rsquo;s being recognised by any chance;
and that to the captain should be consigned the task of preparing his
wife and mother for his restoration to this life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For you see,&rdquo; quoth Captain Jorgan, touching the last
head, &ldquo;it requires caution any way, great joys being as dangerous
as great griefs, if not more dangerous, as being more uncommon (and
therefore less provided against) in this round world of ours.&nbsp;
And besides, I should like to free my name with the ladies, and take
you home again at your brightest and luckiest; so don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s
throw away a chance of success.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain was highly lauded by the brothers for his kind interest
and foresight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now stop!&rdquo; said the captain, coming to a standstill,
and looking from one brother to the other, with quite a new rigging
of wrinkles about each eye; &ldquo;you are of opinion,&rdquo; to the
elder, &ldquo;that you are ra&rsquo;ather slow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I assure you I am very slow,&rdquo; said the honest Hugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wa&rsquo;al,&rdquo; replied the captain, &ldquo;I assure you
that to the best of my belief I am ra&rsquo;ather smart.&nbsp; Now a
slow man ain&rsquo;t good at quick business, is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was clear to both.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You,&rdquo; said the captain, turning to the younger brother,
&ldquo;are a little in love; ain&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a little, Captain Jorgan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much or little, you&rsquo;re sort preoccupied; ain&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was impossible to be denied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a sort preoccupied man ain&rsquo;t good at quick business,
is he?&rdquo; said the captain.</p>
<p>Equally clear on all sides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the captain, &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t in love
myself, and I&rsquo;ve made many a smart run across the ocean, and I
should like to carry on and go ahead with this affair of yours, and
make a run slick through it.&nbsp; Shall I try?&nbsp; Will you hand
it over to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were both delighted to do so, and thanked him heartily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said the captain, taking out his watch.&nbsp;
&ldquo;This is half-past eight a.m., Friday morning.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
jot that down, and we&rsquo;ll compute how many hours we&rsquo;ve been
out when we run into your mother&rsquo;s post-office.&nbsp; There!&nbsp;
The entry&rsquo;s made, and now we go ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went ahead so well that before the Barnstaple lawyer&rsquo;s
office was open next morning, the captain was sitting whistling on the
step of the door, waiting for the clerk to come down the street with
his key and open it.&nbsp; But instead of the clerk there came the master,
with whom the captain fraternised on the spot to an extent that utterly
confounded him.</p>
<p>As he personally knew both Hugh and Alfred, there was no difficulty
in obtaining immediate access to such of the father&rsquo;s papers as
were in his keeping.&nbsp; These were chiefly old letters and cash accounts;
from which the captain, with a shrewdness and despatch that left the
lawyer far behind, established with perfect clearness, by noon, the
following particulars:&mdash;</p>
<p>That one Lawrence Clissold had borrowed of the deceased, at a time
when he was a thriving young tradesman in the town of Barnstaple, the
sum of five hundred pounds.&nbsp; That he had borrowed it on the written
statement that it was to be laid out in furtherance of a speculation
which he expected would raise him to independence; he being, at the
time of writing that letter, no more than a clerk in the house of Dringworth
Brothers, America Square, London.&nbsp; That the money was borrowed
for a stipulated period; but that, when the term was out, the aforesaid
speculation failed, and Clissold was without means of repayment.&nbsp;
That, hereupon, he had written to his creditor, in no very persuasive
terms, vaguely requesting further time.&nbsp; That the creditor had
refused this concession, declaring that he could not afford delay.&nbsp;
That Clissold then paid the debt, accompanying the remittance of the
money with an angry letter describing it as having been advanced by
a relative to save him from ruin.&nbsp; That, in acknowlodging the receipt,
Raybrock had cautioned Clissold to seek to borrow money of him no more,
as he would never so risk money again.</p>
<p>Before the lawyer the captain said never a word in reference to these
discoveries.&nbsp; But when the papers had been put back in their box,
and he and his two companions were well out of the office, his right
leg suffered for it, and he said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So far this run&rsquo;s begun with a fair wind and a prosperous;
for don&rsquo;t you see that all this agrees with that dutiful trust
in his father maintained by the slow member of the Raybrock family?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whether the brothers had seen it before or no, they saw it now.&nbsp;
Not that the captain gave them much time to contemplate the state of
things at their ease, for he instantly whipped them into a chaise again,
and bore them off to Steepways.&nbsp; Although the afternoon was but
just beginning to decline when they reached it, and it was broad day-light,
still they had no difficulty, by dint of muffing the returned sailor
up, and ascending the village rather than descending it, in reaching
Tregarthen&rsquo;s cottage unobserved.&nbsp; Kitty was not visible,
and they surprised Tregarthen sitting writing in the small bay-window
of his little room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the captain, instantly shaking hands with
him, pen and all, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to see you, sir.&nbsp; How do
you do, sir?&nbsp; I told you you&rsquo;d think better of me by-and-by,
and I congratulate you on going to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here the captain&rsquo;s eye fell on Tom Pettifer Ho, engaged in
preparing some cookery at the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That critter,&rdquo; said the captain, smiting his leg, &ldquo;is
a born steward, and never ought to have been in any other way of life.&nbsp;
Stop where you are, Tom, and make yourself useful.&nbsp; Now, Tregarthen,
I&rsquo;m going to try a chair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Accordingly the captain drew one close to him, and went on:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This loving member of the Raybrock family you know, sir.&nbsp;
This slow member of the same family you don&rsquo;t know, sir.&nbsp;
Wa&rsquo;al, these two are brothers,&mdash;fact!&nbsp; Hugh&rsquo;s
come to life again, and here he stands.&nbsp; Now see here, my friend!&nbsp;
You don&rsquo;t want to be told that he was cast away, but you do want
to be told (for there&rsquo;s a purpose in it) that he was cast away
with another man.&nbsp; That man by name was Lawrence Clissold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the mention of this name Tregarthen started and changed colour.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; said the captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a fellow-clerk of mine thirty&mdash;five-and-thirty&mdash;years
ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; said the captain, immediately catching at the
clew: &ldquo;Dringworth Brothers, America Square, London City.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other started again, nodded, and said, &ldquo;That was the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; pursued the captain, &ldquo;between those two
men cast away there arose a mystery concerning the round sum of five
hundred pound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again Tregarthen started, changing colour.&nbsp; Again the captain
said, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Tregarthen only answered, &ldquo;Please to go on,&rdquo; the captain
recounted, very tersely and plainly, the nature of Clissold&rsquo;s
wanderings on the barren island, as he had condensed them in his mind
from the seafaring man.&nbsp; Tregarthen became greatly agitated during
this recital, and at length exclaimed,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clissold was the man who ruined me!&nbsp; I have suspected
it for many a long year, and now I know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how,&rdquo; said the captain, drawing his chair still
closer to Tregarthen, and clapping his hand upon his shoulder,&mdash;&ldquo;how
may you know it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we were fellow-clerks,&rdquo; replied Tregarthen, &ldquo;in
that London house, it was one of my duties to enter daily in a certain
book an account of the sums received that day by the firm, and afterward
paid into the bankers&rsquo;.&nbsp; One memorable day,&mdash;a Wednesday,
the black day of my life,&mdash;among the sums I so entered was one
of five hundred pounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I begin to make it out,&rdquo; said the captain.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was one of Clissold&rsquo;s duties to copy from this entry
a memorandum of the sums which the clerk employed to go to the bankers&rsquo;
paid in there.&nbsp; It was my duty to hand the money to Clissold; it
was Clissold&rsquo;s to hand it to the clerk, with that memorandum of
his writing.&nbsp; On that Wednesday I entered a sum of five hundred
pounds received.&nbsp; I handed that sum, as I handed the other sums
in the day&rsquo;s entry, to Clissold.&nbsp; I was absolutely certain
of it at the time; I have been absolutely certain of it ever since.&nbsp;
A sum of five hundred pounds was afterward found by the house to have
been that day wanting from the bag, from Clissold&rsquo;s memorandum,
and from the entries in my book.&nbsp; Clissold, being questioned, stood
upon his perfect clearness in the matter, and emphatically declared
that he asked no better than to be tested by &lsquo;Tregarthen&rsquo;s
book.&rsquo;&nbsp; My book was examined, and the entry of five hundred
pounds was not there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How not there,&rdquo; said the captain, &ldquo;when you made
it yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tregarthen continued:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was then questioned.&nbsp; Had I made the entry?&nbsp; Certainly
I had.&nbsp; The house produced my book, and it was not there.&nbsp;
I could not deny my book; I could not deny my writing.&nbsp; I knew
there must be forgery by some one; but the writing was wonderfully like
mine, and I could impeach no one if the house could not.&nbsp; I was
required to pay the money back.&nbsp; I did so; and I left the house,
almost broken-hearted, rather than remain there,&mdash;even if I could
have done so,&mdash;with a dark shadow of suspicion always on me.&nbsp;
I returned to my native place, Lanrean, and remained there, clerk to
a mine, until I was appointed to my little post here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I well remember,&rdquo; said the captain, &ldquo;that I told
you that if you had no experience of ill judgments on deceiving appearances,
you were a lucky man.&nbsp; You went hurt at that, and I see why.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus it is,&rdquo; said Tregarthen.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of my own
innocence I have of course been sure; it has been at once my comfort
and my trial.&nbsp; Of Clissold I have always had suspicions almost
amounting to certainty; but they have never been confirmed until now.&nbsp;
For my daughter&rsquo;s sake and for my own I have carried this subject
in my own heart, as the only secret of my life, and have long believed
that it would die with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wa&rsquo;al, my good sir,&rdquo; said the captain cordially,
&ldquo;the present question is, and will be long, I hope, concerning
living, and not dying.&nbsp; Now, here are our two honest friends, the
loving Raybrock and the slow.&nbsp; Here they stand, agreed on one point,
on which I&rsquo;d back &rsquo;em round the world, and right across
it from north to south, and then again from east to west, and through
it, from your deepest Cornish mine to China.&nbsp; It is, that they
will never use this same so-often-mentioned sum of money, and that restitution
of it must be made to you.&nbsp; These two, the loving member and the
slow, for the sake of the right and of their father&rsquo;s memory,
will have it ready for you to-morrow.&nbsp; Take it, and ease their
minds and mine, and end a most unfortunate transaction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tregarthen took the captain by the hand, and gave his hand to each
of the young men, but positively and finally answered No.&nbsp; He said,
they trusted to his word, and he was glad of it, and at rest in his
mind; but there was no proof, and the money must remain as it was.&nbsp;
All were very earnest over this; and earnestness in men, when they are
right and true, is so impressive, that Mr. Pettifer deserted his cookery
and looked on quite moved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so,&rdquo; said the captain, &ldquo;so we come&mdash;as
that lawyer-crittur over yonder where we were this morning might&mdash;to
mere proof; do we?&nbsp; We must have it; must we?&nbsp; How?&nbsp;
From this Clissold&rsquo;s wanderings, and from what you say, it ain&rsquo;t
hard to make out that there was a neat forgery of your writing committed
by the too smart rowdy that was grease and ashes when I made his acquaintance,
and a substitution of a forged leaf in your book for a real and torn
leaf torn out.&nbsp; Now was that real and true leaf then and there
destroyed?&nbsp; No,&mdash;for says he, in his drunken way, he slipped
it into a crack in his own desk, because you came into the office before
there was time to burn it, and could never get back to it arterwards.&nbsp;
Wait a bit.&nbsp; Where is that desk now?&nbsp; Do you consider it likely
to be in America Square, London City?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tregarthen shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The house has not, for years, transacted business in that
place.&nbsp; I have heard of it, and read of it, as removed, enlarged,
every way altered.&nbsp; Things alter so fast in these times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think so,&rdquo; returned the captain, with compassion;
&ldquo;but you should come over and see <i>me</i> afore you talk about
<i>that</i>.&nbsp; Wa&rsquo;al, now.&nbsp; This desk, this paper,&mdash;this
paper, this desk,&rdquo; said the captain, ruminating and walking about,
and looking, in his uneasy abstraction, into Mr. Pettifer&rsquo;s hat
on a table, among other things.&nbsp; &ldquo;This desk, this paper,&mdash;this
paper, this desk,&rdquo; the captain continued, musing and roaming about
the room, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d give&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, he gave nothing, but took up his steward&rsquo;s hat instead,
and stood looking into it, as if he had just come into church.&nbsp;
After that he roamed again, and again said, &ldquo;This desk, belonging
to this house of Dringworth Brothers, America Square, London City&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Pettifer, still strangely moved, and now more moved than before,
cut the captain off as he backed across the room, and bespake him thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Jorgan, I have been wishful to engage your attention,
but I couldn&rsquo;t do it.&nbsp; I am unwilling to interrupt Captain
Jorgan, but I must do it.&nbsp; <i>I</i> knew something about that house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain stood stock-still and looked at him,&mdash;with his (Mr.
Pettifer&rsquo;s) hat under his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re aware,&rdquo; pursued his steward, &ldquo;that
I was once in the broking business, Captain Jorgan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was aware,&rdquo; said the captain, &ldquo;that you had
failed in that calling, and in half the businesses going, Tom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite so, Captain Jorgan; but I failed in the broking
business.&nbsp; I was partners with my brother, sir.&nbsp; There was
a sale of old office furniture at Dringworth Brothers&rsquo; when the
house was moved from America Square, and me and my brother made what
we call in the trade a Deal there, sir.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;ll make bold
to say, sir, that the only thing I ever had from my brother, or from
any relation,&mdash;for my relations have mostly taken property from
me instead of giving me any,&mdash;was an old desk we bought at that
same sale, with a crack in it.&nbsp; My brother wouldn&rsquo;t have
given me even that, when we broke partnership, if it had been worth
anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is that desk now?&rdquo; said the captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Captain Jorgan,&rdquo; replied the steward, &ldquo;I
couldn&rsquo;t say for certain where it is now; but when I saw it last,&mdash;which
was last time we were outward bound,&mdash;it was at a very nice lady&rsquo;s
at Wapping, along with a little chest of mine which was detained for
a small matter of a bill owing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain, instead of paying that rapt attention to his steward
which was rendered by the other three persons present, went to Church
again, in respect of the steward&rsquo;s hat.&nbsp; And a most especially
agitated and memorable face the captain produced from it, after a short
pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Tom,&rdquo; said the captain, &ldquo;I spoke to you,
when we first came here, respecting your constitutional weakness on
the subject of sun-stroke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will my slow friend,&rdquo; said the captain, &ldquo;lend
me his arm, or I shall sink right back&rsquo;ards into this blessed
steward&rsquo;s cookery?&nbsp; Now, Tom,&rdquo; pursued the captain,
when the required assistance was given, &ldquo;on your oath as a steward,
didn&rsquo;t you take that desk to pieces to make a better one of it,
and put it together fresh,&mdash;or something of the kind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On my oath I did, sir,&rdquo; replied the steward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And by the blessing of Heaven, my friends, one and all,&rdquo;
cried the captain, radiant with joy,&mdash;&ldquo;of the Heaven that
put it into this Tom Pettifer&rsquo;s head to take so much care of his
head against the bright sun,&mdash;he lined his hat with the original
leaf in Tregarthen&rsquo;s writing,&mdash;and here it is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that the captain, to the utter destruction of Mr. Pettifer&rsquo;s
favourite hat, produced the book-leaf, very much worn, but still legible,
and gave both his legs such tremendous slaps that they were heard far
off in the bay, and never accounted for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A quarter past five p.m.,&rdquo; said the captain, pulling
out his watch, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s thirty-three hours and a quarter
in all, and a pritty run!&rdquo;</p>
<p>How they were all overpowered with delight and triumph; how the money
was restored, then and there, to Tregarthen; how Tregarthen, then and
there, gave it all to his daughter; how the captain undertook to go
to Dringworth Brothers and re-establish the reputation of their forgotten
old clerk; how Kitty came in, and was nearly torn to pieces, and the
marriage was reappointed, needs not to be told.&nbsp; Nor how she and
the young fisherman went home to the post-office to prepare the way
for the captain&rsquo;s coming, by declaring him to be the mightiest
of men, who had made all their fortunes,&mdash;and then dutifully withdrew
together, in order that he might have the domestic coast entirely to
himself.&nbsp; How he availed himself of it is all that remains to tell.</p>
<p>Deeply delighted with his trust, and putting his heart into it, he
raised the latch of the post-office parlour where Mrs. Raybrock and
the young widow sat, and said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I come in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure you may, Captain Jorgan!&rdquo; replied the old lady.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And good reason you have to be free of the house, though you
have not been too well used in it by some who ought to have known better.&nbsp;
I ask your pardon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No you don&rsquo;t, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said the captain,
&ldquo;for I won&rsquo;t let you.&nbsp; Wa&rsquo;al, to be sure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time he had taken a chair on the hearth between them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never felt such an evil spirit in the whole course of my life!&nbsp;
There!&nbsp; I tell you!&nbsp; I could a&rsquo;most have cut my own
connection.&nbsp; Like the dealer in my country, away West, who when
he had let himself be outdone in a bargain, said to himself, &lsquo;Now
I tell you what!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll never speak to you again.&rsquo;&nbsp;
And he never did, but joined a settlement of oysters, and translated
the multiplication table into their language,&mdash;which is a fact
that can be proved.&nbsp; If you doubt it, mention it to any oyster
you come across, and see if he&rsquo;ll have the face to contradict
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took the child from her mother&rsquo;s lap and set it on his knee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit afraid of me now, you see.&nbsp; Knows I am fond
of small people.&nbsp; I have a child, and she&rsquo;s a girl, and I
sing to her sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you sing?&rdquo; asked Margaret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a long song, my dear.</p>
<blockquote><p>Silas Jorgan<br />
Played the organ.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s about all.&nbsp; And sometimes I tell her stories,&mdash;stories
of sailors supposed to be lost, and recovered after all hope was abandoned.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Here the captain musingly went back to his song,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Silas Jorgan<br />
Played the organ;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>repeating it with his eyes on the fire, as he softly danced the child
on his knee.&nbsp; For he felt that Margaret had stopped working.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the captain, still looking at the fire, &ldquo;I
make up stories and tell &rsquo;em to that child.&nbsp; Stories of shipwreck
on desert islands, and long delay in getting back to civilised lauds.&nbsp;
It is to stories the like of that, mostly, that</p>
<blockquote><p>Silas Jorgan<br />
Plays the organ.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was no light in the room but the light of the fire; for the
shades of night were on the village, and the stars had begun to peep
out of the sky one by one, as the houses of the village peeped out from
among the foliage when the night departed.&nbsp; The captain felt that
Margaret&rsquo;s eyes were upon him, and thought it discreetest to keep
his own eyes on the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I make &rsquo;em up,&rdquo; said the captain.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
make up stories of brothers brought together by the good providence
of GOD,&mdash;of sons brought back to mothers, husbands brought back
to wives, fathers raised from the deep, for little children like herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Margaret&rsquo;s touch was on his arm, and he could not choose but
look round now.&nbsp; Next moment her hand moved imploringly to his
breast, and she was on her knees before him,&mdash;supporting the mother,
who was also kneeling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; said the captain.&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
the matter?</p>
<blockquote><p>Silas Jorgan<br />
Played the&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Their looks and tears were too much for him, and he could not finish
the song, short as it was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mistress Margaret, you have borne ill fortune well.&nbsp;
Could you bear good fortune equally well, if it was to come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so.&nbsp; I thankfully and humbly and earnestly hope
so!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wa&rsquo;al, my dear,&rdquo; said the captain, &ldquo;p&rsquo;rhaps
it has come.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s&mdash;don&rsquo;t be frightened&mdash;shall
I say the word&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The thanks they fervently addressed to Heaven were again too much
for the captain, who openly took out his handkerchief and dried his
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s no further off,&rdquo; resumed the captain, &ldquo;than
my country.&nbsp; Indeed, he&rsquo;s no further off than his own native
country.&nbsp; To tell you the truth, he&rsquo;s no further off than
Falmouth.&nbsp; Indeed, I doubt if he&rsquo;s quite so fur.&nbsp; Indeed,
if you was sure you could bear it nicely, and I was to do no more than
whistle for him&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain&rsquo;s trust was discharged.&nbsp; A rush came, and
they were all together again.</p>
<p>This was a fine opportunity for Tom Pettifer to appear with a tumbler
of cold water, and he presently appeared with it, and administered it
to the ladies; at the same time soothing them, and composing their dresses,
exactly as if they had been passengers crossing the Channel.&nbsp; The
extent to which the captain slapped his legs, when Mr. Pettifer acquitted
himself of this act of stewardship, could have been thoroughly appreciated
by no one but himself; inasmuch as he must have slapped them black and
blue, and they must have smarted tremendously.</p>
<p>He couldn&rsquo;t stay for the wedding, having a few appointments
to keep at the irreconcilable distance of about four thousand miles.&nbsp;
So next morning all the village cheered him up to the level ground above,
and there he shook hands with a complete Census of its population, and
invited the whole, without exception, to come and stay several months
with him at Salem, Mass., U.S.&nbsp; And there as he stood on the spot
where he had seen that little golden picture of love and parting, and
from which he could that morning contemplate another golden picture
with a vista of golden years in it, little Kitty put her arms around
his neck, and kissed him on both his bronzed cheeks, and laid her pretty
face upon his storm-beaten breast, in sight of all,&mdash;ashamed to
have called such a noble captain names.&nbsp; And there the captain
waved his hat over his head three final times; and there he was last
seen, going away accompanied by Tom Pettifer Ho, and carrying his hands
in his pockets.&nbsp; And there, before that ground was softened with
the fallen leaves of three more summers, a rosy little boy took his
first unsteady run to a fair young mother&rsquo;s breast, and the name
of that infant fisherman was Jorgan Raybrock.</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
